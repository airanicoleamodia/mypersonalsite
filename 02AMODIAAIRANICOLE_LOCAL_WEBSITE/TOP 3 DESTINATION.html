            <strong>Jomalig Island</strong>
        </font>
        <font size="5">
            <p>Jomalig Island is located in the province of Quezon, Philippines. The island’s name is pronounced as “Humalig” derived from the word “Humalik”, a love story legend. The island, famous for its golden sand beaches, has quite risen in popularity
                but the place has remained undisturbed because of its remote location. It’s the farthest island municipality of the Quezon Province requiring 4-6 hours boat ride from Ungos Port, Real, Quezon.</p>
